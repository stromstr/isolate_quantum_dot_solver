6. Compiling and dependencies
 
   Intel MKL libraries are required to compile the code, specify the absulte 
   path of MKL in code/Makefile and just do "make" to compile it. Also, the 
   final excutable file "hsms" should be changed to $YOURPATH/iso*.*/hsms.

7. Physical quantities calculating
  
   Varies of physical quantities of isolate QD system could be evaluated in "iso",
   each of them are given a clear name such as "corr"(correlation function), you 
   can find how the are defined in "/code/spec" or even add new quantity that has 
   not been included in it.   
   
   Basicly, you can set the parameters in input and run "hsms" to get the results.
   The meaning of the paremeters has been clarified in input and similarly you can 
   add new parameters in it.
